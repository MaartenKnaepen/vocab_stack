# Phase 2: Leitner Algorithm Implementation - ✅ COMPLETE

**Completion Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Time Taken**: ~1 hour  
**Status**: All tests passing ✅

---

## 🎯 Accomplishments

### Core Algorithm Implemented
✅ Complete Leitner spaced repetition system with all features:

1. **Date Helper Utilities**
   - Box interval mapping (1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days)
   - Next review date calculation
   - Due date checking
   - Days until review calculation

2. **Leitner Service**
   - Get cards due for review (with filtering)
   - Process review with state updates
   - Get card statistics
   - Get topic progress
   - Reset card functionality

3. **Box Progression Logic**
   - Correct answer: Move to next box (1→2→3→4→5)
   - Incorrect answer: Move back to Box 1
   - Box 5 stays at Box 5 on correct (mastered)
   - Review dates calculated based on new box

4. **Review History**
   - All reviews recorded to database
   - Tracks correctness, time spent, date
   - Statistics calculated (accuracy, counts)

## 🔍 Algorithm Verification

### Box Intervals (Tested ✅)
```
Box 1: Daily (1 day)
Box 2: Every 3 days
Box 3: Weekly (7 days)
Box 4: Bi-weekly (14 days)
Box 5: Monthly (30 days)
```

### Progression Rules (Tested ✅)
- ✅ Correct answer: Box N → Box N+1 (max 5)
- ✅ Incorrect answer: Any Box → Box 1
- ✅ Box 5 + Correct: Stays in Box 5 (mastered)
- ✅ Next review date = Today + Box interval

### Statistics Tracking (Tested ✅)
- ✅ Total reviews counted
- ✅ Correct/incorrect counts tracked
- ✅ Accuracy percentage calculated
- ✅ Last reviewed date recorded
- ✅ Next review date updated

### Progress Tracking (Tested ✅)
- ✅ Cards counted by box
- ✅ Cards due today calculated
- ✅ Mastered cards (Box 5) counted
- ✅ Mastery percentage calculated

## 🔧 API Reference

### LeitnerService Methods

#### get_due_cards(topic_id, user_id)
```python
# Get all cards due for review today
cards = LeitnerService.get_due_cards(topic_id=1, user_id=1)
# Returns: List[Flashcard]
```

#### process_review(flashcard_id, user_id, was_correct, time_spent_seconds)
```python
# Process a review and update state
result = LeitnerService.process_review(
    flashcard_id=1,
    user_id=1,
    was_correct=True,
    time_spent_seconds=15
)
# Returns: dict with old_box, new_box, next_review_date, etc.
```

#### get_card_statistics(flashcard_id)
```python
# Get statistics for a card
stats = LeitnerService.get_card_statistics(flashcard_id=1)
# Returns: dict with box_number, correct_count, accuracy, etc.
```

#### get_topic_progress(topic_id, user_id)
```python
# Get progress for a topic
progress = LeitnerService.get_topic_progress(topic_id=1, user_id=1)
# Returns: dict with total, by_box, due_today, mastered, mastered_percentage
```

#### reset_card(flashcard_id)
```python
# Reset card back to Box 1
LeitnerService.reset_card(flashcard_id=1)
```

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **Test Logic Error** - Fixed test to expect intervals based on NEW box after progression
   - Issue: Expected Box 1 interval after moving to Box 2
   - Fix: Updated to expect Box 2+ intervals after progression

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Phase 2 is complete! Ready to proceed with:

**Phase 3: Basic UI Components**
- Navigation component
- Dashboard page
- Flashcard review interface
- State management with Reflex

## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### Date Calculation Strategy
```python
# Each box has a fixed interval
BOX_INTERVALS = {1: 1, 2: 3, 3: 7, 4: 14, 5: 30}

# Next review = last_reviewed + interval
next_date = last_reviewed + timedelta(days=BOX_INTERVALS[box])
```

### State Update Logic
```python
if was_correct:
    box_number = min(box_number + 1, 5)  # Max at 5
    correct_count += 1
else:
    box_number = 1  # Always reset to 1
    incorrect_count += 1

next_review_date = calculate_next_review_date(box_number)
```

### Progress Calculation
```python
mastered_count = count(cards where box_number == 5)
mastered_percentage = (mastered_count / total_cards) * 100
due_count = count(cards where next_review_date <= today)
```

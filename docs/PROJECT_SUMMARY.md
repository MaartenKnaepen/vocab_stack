## Lessons Learned

### Reflex Reactive Patterns
**Key Discovery**: Reflex's reactive Vars cannot be used with Python operations at render time.

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. ✅ Precompute booleans in state methods
2. ✅ Use `.to_string()` for string concatenation
3. ✅ Create simple lists for rendering
4. ✅ Use `rx.cond()` for conditionals
5. ✅ Avoid f-strings with Vars

**Documentation**: Created comprehensive guide in `docs/reflex_reactive_patterns.md`

### Database Migrations
**Challenge**: Alembic generated incompatible types (sqlmodel.AutoString)

**Solution**: Replaced with standard SQLAlchemy types (sa.String) and added server defaults

### Settings Integration
**Approach**: Implemented in stages:
1. Store preferences in database
2. Load on page mount
3. Apply in logic/rendering
4. Verify functionality

**Result**: All 5 preferences fully integrated and working

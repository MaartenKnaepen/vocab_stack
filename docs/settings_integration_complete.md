# Settings Integration Complete

## Overview
All user preferences from Phase 6 Settings are now fully integrated throughout the application. Users can customize their learning experience and see the changes take effect immediately.

---

## 1. Show Examples ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED

### What It Does
Controls whether example sentences appear during flashcard review.

### Implementation
**Files Modified:**
- `vocab_stack/pages/review.py`
  - Added `show_examples` state variable
  - Loads preference in `load_user_preferences()`
  - Conditional display: `rx.cond(ReviewState.show_examples & (card["example"] != ""), ...)`

### How It Works
1. User toggles "Show examples during review" in Settings
2. Saves to database (user.show_examples)
3. Review page loads preference on mount
4. Examples only show if BOTH conditions are true:
   - User preference is True
   - Card has an example text

### Testing
1. Settings → Toggle OFF "Show examples"
2. Save Preferences
3. Review → Flip card with example
4. **Result**: Example section hidden
5. Toggle ON → Example section visible

---

## 2. Cards Per Session ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED

### What It Does
Limits the number of cards shown in each review session.

### Implementation
**Files Modified:**
- `vocab_stack/pages/review.py`
  - Added `cards_per_session` state variable
  - Loads preference in `load_user_preferences()`
  - Limits cards: `self.cards_to_review = all_cards[:self.cards_per_session]`

### How It Works
1. User adjusts "Cards per Session" slider (5-100) in Settings
2. Saves to database (user.cards_per_session)
3. Review page loads preference on mount
4. Fetches all due cards, then slices to first N cards
5. Progress shows "1 / N" where N = cards_per_session

### Testing
1. Settings → Set slider to 5
2. Save Preferences
3. Review → Check progress indicator
4. **Result**: Shows max 5 cards ("1 / 5", "2 / 5", etc.)

---

## 3. Review Order ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED

### What It Does
Controls the order in which cards are presented during review sessions.

### Options
- **random** (default): Cards shuffled randomly
- **oldest_first**: Cards sorted by creation date, oldest first
- **newest_first**: Cards sorted by creation date, newest first

### Implementation
**Files Modified:**
- `vocab_stack/services/leitner_service.py`
  - Updated `get_due_cards()` signature with `review_order` parameter
  - Added sorting logic:
    - `oldest_first`: `query.order_by(Flashcard.created_at.asc())`
    - `newest_first`: `query.order_by(Flashcard.created_at.desc())`
    - `random`: `random.shuffle()` on fetched list

- `vocab_stack/pages/review.py`
  - Added `review_order` state variable
  - Loads preference in `load_user_preferences()`
  - Passes to `LeitnerService.get_due_cards(review_order=self.review_order)`

### How It Works
1. User selects review order in Settings dropdown
2. Saves to database (user.review_order)
3. Review page loads preference on mount
4. Passes order to LeitnerService when fetching cards
5. Cards returned in specified order

### Testing
1. Create multiple flashcards on different dates
2. Settings → Select "oldest_first"
3. Save Preferences
4. Review → Cards should appear oldest to newest
5. Change to "newest_first" → Cards reverse order
6. Change to "random" → Cards shuffled each session

## 4. Daily Goal ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED

### What It Does
Displays user's daily review goal and current progress on the Dashboard.

### Implementation
**Files Modified:**
- `vocab_stack/pages/dashboard.py`
  - Added state variables:
    - `daily_goal`: Target reviews per day
    - `reviews_today`: Actual reviews completed
    - `goal_percentage`: Progress percentage (0-100)
    - `goal_reached`: Boolean flag when goal met
  
  - Added `load_daily_goal_progress()` method:
    - Loads `daily_goal` from SettingsService
    - Loads `reviews_today` from StatisticsService
    - Calculates percentage
    - Sets `goal_reached` flag
  
  - Updated dashboard UI:
    - Two-column grid with "Cards Due" and "Daily Goal" cards
    - Progress bar showing completion percentage
    - "🎉 Goal Reached!" badge when complete
    - Shows "X / Y" format (e.g., "25 / 50")

### How It Works
1. User adjusts "Daily Goal" slider (10-200) in Settings
2. Saves to database (user.daily_goal)
3. Dashboard loads preference on mount
4. Fetches today's review count from statistics
5. Calculates progress: (reviews_today / daily_goal) * 100
6. Displays progress bar and percentage
7. Shows celebratory badge when goal reached

### Visual Design
- **Daily Goal Card**:
  - Header: "Daily Goal" with optional "🎉 Goal Reached!" badge
  - Large heading: "25 / 50" (reviews_today / daily_goal)
  - Progress bar: Visual representation (0-100%)
  - Subtext: "50% complete"

### Testing
1. Settings → Set daily goal to 10
2. Save Preferences
3. Dashboard → Check "Daily Goal" card
4. **Result**: Shows "0 / 10" with 0% progress
5. Complete 5 reviews
6. Refresh Dashboard → Shows "5 / 10" with 50% progress
7. Complete 5 more reviews
8. Refresh Dashboard → Shows "10 / 10" with 100% and "🎉 Goal Reached!" badge

## 5. Theme (Light/Dark) ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED

### What It Does
Applies user's theme preference (light or dark mode) to the entire application.

### Implementation
**Files Modified:**
- `vocab_stack/app.py`
  - Added `get_user_theme()` function:
    - Loads theme from SettingsService
    - Returns "light" or "dark"
    - Defaults to "light" if database not initialized
    - Handles exceptions gracefully
  
  - Loads theme at app initialization:
    - `user_theme = get_user_theme()`
    - Passes to app: `rx.App(theme=rx.theme(appearance=user_theme, ...))`

### How It Works
1. User selects theme in Settings dropdown
2. Saves to database (user.theme)
3. **Requires app restart** to take effect
4. On next app start:
   - `get_user_theme()` reads from database
   - Theme applied to all pages
5. All components use theme-aware colors automatically

### Important Notes
- **Theme requires app restart** (not live switching)
- Theme is loaded once at app initialization
- Uses Reflex's `appearance` parameter
- All Reflex components respect theme automatically
- Custom colors (e.g., `color="gray"`) adapt to theme

### Testing
1. Settings → Select "dark" theme
2. Save Preferences
3. **Restart the Reflex app** (stop and start `reflex run`)
4. **Result**: All pages now use dark mode
5. Change back to "light" → Restart → Light mode applied

### Future Enhancement (Live Theme Switching)
To enable live theme switching without restart:
- Add a global state for theme
- Use `rx.color_mode_button()` or custom toggle
- Update theme dynamically via state
- Persist choice to database

## Known Limitations

### Theme Switching
- **Limitation**: Requires app restart
- **Reason**: Reflex app theme set at initialization, not runtime-changeable
- **Workaround**: None currently (architectural limitation)
- **Future**: Could implement live theme switching with color mode state

### User Authentication
- **Limitation**: All preferences hardcoded to user_id=1
- **Reason**: No authentication system yet
- **Impact**: Multi-user scenarios not supported
- **Future**: Add authentication in Phase 7+

### Review Order Persistence
- **Limitation**: Order resets if user navigates away and back
- **Reason**: State not persisted between page loads
- **Impact**: Minor UX issue
- **Workaround**: Preferences re-loaded on mount

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- Settings loaded once per page mount (efficient)
- No repeated queries during session
- Preferences cached in state

### Review Order
- Random shuffle done in-memory (fast)
- Database ordering for oldest/newest (efficient)
- No performance impact on typical card volumes (<1000)

### Daily Goal Calculation
- Leverages existing StatisticsService
- Single additional query for reviews_today
- Minimal overhead

---

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Live Theme Toggle**: Add navbar theme button for instant switching
2. **Review Order Preview**: Show sample order in Settings
3. **Daily Goal Streak**: Track consecutive days of meeting goal
4. **Goal Notifications**: Alert when goal reached

### Long-term Enhancements
1. **Per-Topic Goals**: Set different goals for different topics
2. **Adaptive Goals**: Suggest goals based on performance
3. **Review Schedule**: Custom review times (morning/evening)
4. **Difficulty Setting**: Adjust Leitner interval multipliers
5. **Audio Settings**: Text-to-speech for cards
6. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Custom key bindings

# Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Models - ✅ COMPLETE

**Completion Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Time Taken**: ~1 hour  
**Status**: All tests passing ✅

---

## 🎯 Accomplishments

### Database Models Created
✅ All 5 database models implemented with proper relationships:

1. **User** - User account information
   - Fields: id, username, email, created_at
   - Relationships: One-to-Many with Flashcards

2. **Topic** - Vocabulary categories  
   - Fields: id, name, description, created_at
   - Relationships: One-to-Many with Flashcards

3. **Flashcard** - Individual vocabulary cards
   - Fields: id, front, back, example, created_at, topic_id, user_id
   - Relationships: Many-to-One with Topic and User, One-to-One with LeitnerState, One-to-Many with ReviewHistory

4. **LeitnerState** - Spaced repetition state tracking
   - Fields: id, box_number, next_review_date, last_reviewed, correct_count, incorrect_count, flashcard_id
   - Relationships: One-to-One with Flashcard

5. **ReviewHistory** - Historical review records
   - Fields: id, review_date, was_correct, time_spent_seconds, flashcard_id, user_id
   - Relationships: Many-to-One with Flashcard and User

## 🗄️ Database Status

- **Database File**: `reflex.db` (SQLite)
- **Tables Created**: 5 tables with proper constraints
- **Sample Data**: Seeded with 1 user, 3 topics, 2 flashcards
- **Foreign Keys**: All relationships working correctly
- **Indexes**: Created on username and topic name

## 🔍 Verification

### Database Tables
```sql
✅ user (id, username, email, created_at)
✅ topic (id, name, description, created_at)
✅ flashcard (id, front, back, example, created_at, topic_id, user_id)
✅ leitnerstate (id, box_number, next_review_date, last_reviewed, correct_count, incorrect_count, flashcard_id)
✅ reviewhistory (id, review_date, was_correct, time_spent_seconds, flashcard_id, user_id)
```

### Relationships Verified
- ✅ User → Flashcards (One-to-Many)
- ✅ Topic → Flashcards (One-to-Many)
- ✅ Flashcard → LeitnerState (One-to-One)
- ✅ Flashcard → ReviewHistory (One-to-Many)
- ✅ Flashcard → Topic (Many-to-One)
- ✅ Flashcard → User (Many-to-One)

## 📊 Code Statistics

- **Total Lines Written**: ~360 lines of Python code
- **Models**: 5 database tables
- **Test Cases**: 6 comprehensive tests
- **Scripts**: 2 utility scripts

---

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **Foreign Key Deletion** - Updated test to properly delete related records before parent
2. **Test Database Cleanup** - Added `drop_all_tables()` to ensure clean test runs

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Phase 1 is complete! Ready to proceed with:

**Phase 2: Leitner Algorithm Implementation**
- Date calculation utilities
- Leitner service with box progression logic
- Review scheduling system
- Comprehensive algorithm tests

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **rx.Model** works seamlessly with SQLModel
2. **Relationship(back_populates="...")** enables bidirectional navigation
3. **Field(foreign_key="table.id")** creates proper constraints
4. **One-to-One** relationships need `unique=True` on foreign key
5. **session.flush()** required to get IDs before commit

## 📝 Commands Used

```bash
# Initialize database
python scripts/init_db.py

# Seed sample data
